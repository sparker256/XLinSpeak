"""XPLM APIs (based on CHeaders/XPLM/XPLMInstance.h)

 This API provides instanced drawing of X-Plane objects (.obj files). In
 contrast to old drawing APIs, which required you to draw your own objects
 per-frame, the instancing API allows you to simply register an OBJ for
 drawing, then move or manipulate it later (as needed).

 This provides one tremendous benefit: it keeps all dataref operations for
 your object in one place. Because datarefs are main thread only, allowing
 dataref access anywhere is a serious performance bottleneck for the
 simulator---the whole simulator has to pause and wait for each dataref
 access. This performance penalty will only grow worse as X-Plane moves
 toward an ever more heavily multithreaded engine.

 The instancing API allows X-Plane to isolate all dataref manipulations for
 all plugin object drawing to one place, potentially providing huge
 performance gains.

 Here's how it works:

 When an instance is created, it provides a list of all datarefs you want to
 manipulate in for the OBJ in the future. This list of datarefs replaces the
 ad-hoc collections of dataref objects previously used by art assets. Then,
 per-frame, you can manipulate the instance by passing in a "block" of
 packed floats representing the current values of the datarefs for your
 instance. (Note that the ordering of this set of packed floats must exactly
 match the ordering of the datarefs when you created your instance.)
