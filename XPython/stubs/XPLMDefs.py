# GLOBAL DEFINITIONS
###############################################################################
# These definitions are used in all parts of the SDK.


###############################################################################
# XPLMPluginID
#
# Each plug-in is identified by a unique integer ID.  This ID can be used to
# disable or enable a plug-in, or discover what plug-in is 'running' at the
# time.  A plug-in ID is unique within the currently running instance of
# X-Plane unless plug-ins are reloaded.  Plug-ins may receive a different
# unique ID each time they are loaded.
#
# For persistent identification of plug-ins, use XPLMFindPluginBySignature in
# XPLMUtiltiies.h
#
# -1 indicates no plug-in.

# No plugin
XPLM_NO_PLUGIN_ID = -1

# X-Plane itself
XPLM_PLUGIN_XPLANE = 0

# The current XPLM revision is 303
kXPLM_Version = 303

###############################################################################
# XPLMKeyFlags
#
# These bitfields define modifier keys in a platform independent way. When a
# key is pressed, a series of messages are sent to your plugin.  The down
# flag is set in the first of these messages, and the up flag in the last.
# While the key is held down, messages are sent with neither to indicate that
# the key is being held down as a repeated character.
#
# The control flag is mapped to the control flag on Macintosh and PC.
# Generally X-Plane uses the control key and not the command key on
# Macintosh, providing a consistent interface across platforms that does not
# necessarily match the Macintosh user interface guidelines.  There is not
# yet a way for plugins to access the Macintosh control keys without using
# #ifdefed code.

# The shift key is down
xplm_ShiftFlag = 1

# The option or alt key is down
xplm_OptionAltFlag = 2

# The control key is down
xplm_ControlFlag = 4

# The key is being pressed down
xplm_DownFlag = 8

# The key is being released
xplm_UpFlag = 16


###############################################################################
# ASCII CONTROL KEY CODES
###############################################################################
# These definitions define how various control keys are mapped to ASCII key
# codes. Not all key presses generate an ASCII value, so plugin code should
# be prepared to see null characters come from the keyboard...this usually
# represents a key stroke that has no equivalent ASCII, like a page-down
# press.  Use virtual key codes to find these key strokes. ASCII key codes
# take into account modifier keys; shift keys will affect capitals and
# punctuation; control key combinations may have no vaild ASCII and produce
# NULL.  To detect control-key combinations, use virtual key codes, not ASCII
# keys.

###############################################################################
# VIRTUAL KEY CODES
###############################################################################
# These are cross-platform defines for every distinct keyboard press on the
# computer. Every physical key on the keyboard has a virtual key code. So
# the "two" key on the top row of the main keyboard has a different code
# from the "two" key on the numeric key pad. But the 'w' and 'W' character
# are indistinguishable by virtual key code because they are the same
# physical key (one with and one without the shift key).
#
# Use virtual key codes to detect keystrokes that do not have ASCII
# equivalents, allow the user to map the numeric keypad separately from the
# main keyboard, and detect control key and other modifier-key combinations
# that generate ASCII control key sequences (many of which are not available
# directly via character keys in the SDK).
#
# To assign virtual key codes we started with the Microsoft set but made some
# additions and changes. A few differences:
#
# 1. Modifier keys are not available as virtual key codes. You cannot get
# distinct modifier press and release messages. Please do not try to use
# modifier keys as regular keys; doing so will almost certainly interfere
# with users' abilities to use the native x-plane key bindings.
#
# 2. Some keys that do not exist on both Mac and PC keyboards are removed.
#
# 3. Do not assume that the values of these keystrokes are interchangeable
# with MS v-keys.
