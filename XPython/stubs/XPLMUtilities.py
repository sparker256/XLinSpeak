X-PLANE USER INTERACTION
************************
The user interaction APIs let you simulate commands the user can do with a
joystick, keyboard etc. Note that it is generally safer for future
compatibility to use one of these commands than to manipulate the
underlying sim data.

xplm_key_* enums represent all the keystrokes available within X-Plane. They can
be sent to X-Plane directly. For example, you can reverse thrust using
these enumerations.

xplm_joy_*  are enumerations for all of the things you can do with a joystick
button in X-Plane. They currently match the buttons menu in the equipment
setup dialog, but these enums will be stable even if they change in
X-Plane.

The plug-in system is based on Austin's cross-platform OpenGL framework and
could theoretically be adapted to run in other apps like WorldMaker. The
plug-in system also runs against a test harness for internal development
and could be adapted to another flight sim (in theory at least). So the xplm_Host_*
enum is provided to allow plug-ins to indentify what app they are running
under.

xplm_Language_* enums define what language the sim is running in. These enumerations
do not imply that the sim can or does run in all of these languages; they
simply provide a known encoding in the event that a given sim version is
localized to a certain language.

xplm_DataFile_* enums define types of data files you can load or unload using the
SDK.


X-PLANE COMMAND MANAGEMENT
**************************
The command management APIs let plugins interact with the command-system in
X-Plane, the abstraction behind keyboard presses and joystick buttons. This
API lets you create new commands and modify the behavior (or get
notification) of existing ones.

An X-Plane command consists of three phases: a beginning, continuous
repetition, and an ending. The command may be repeated zero times in the
event that the user presses a button only momentarily.

A command ref is an opaque identifier for an X-Plane command. Command
references stay the same for the life of your plugin but not between
executions of X-Plane. Command refs are used to execute commands, create
commands, and create callbacks for particular commands.

Note that a command is not "owned" by a particular plugin. Since many
plugins may participate in a command's execution, the command does not go
away if the plugin that created it is unloaded.
