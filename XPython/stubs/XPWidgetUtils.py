XPWidgetUtils - USAGE NOTES

The XPWidgetUtils library contains useful functions that make writing and
using widgets less of a pain.

One set of functions are the widget behavior functions. These functions
each add specific useful behaviors to widgets. They can be used in two
manners:

1. You can add a widget behavior function to a widget as a callback proc
using the XPAddWidgetCallback function. The widget will gain that behavior.
Remember that the last function you add has highest priority. You can use
this to change or augment the behavior of an existing finished widget.

2. You can call a widget function from inside your own widget function.
This allows you to include useful behaviors in custom-built widgets. A
number of the standard widgets get their behavior from this library. To do
this, call the behavior function from your function first. If it returns 1,
that means it handled the event and you don't need to; simply return 1.

    This function creates a series of widgets from a table...see
    XPCreateWidget_t above. Pass in an array of widget creation structures and
    an array of widget IDs that will receive each widget.

    Widget parents are specified by index into the created widget table,
    allowing you to create nested widget structures. You can create multiple
    widget trees in one table. Generally you should create widget trees from
    the top down.

    You can also pass in a widget ID that will be used when the widget's parent
    is listed as PARAM_PARENT; this allows you to embed widgets created with
    XPUCreateWidgets in a widget created previously.

    inWidgetDefs: sequence of sequences with the following fields
        left, top, right, bottom: integers
        visible: integer
        descriptor: string
        isRoot: integer
        continerIndex: integer
        widgetClass: integer
            This structure contains all of the parameters needed to create
            a wiget. It is used with XPUCreateWidgets to create widgets
            in bulk from an array. All parameters correspond to those of
            XPCreateWidget except for the container index. If the container
            index is equal to the index of a widget in the array, the widget
            in the array passed to XPUCreateWidgets is used as the parent
            of this widget. Note that if you pass an index greater than your
            own position in the array, the parent you are requesting will not
            exist yet. If the container index is NO_PARENT, the parent widget
            is specified as None. If the container index is PARAM_PARENT,
            the widget passed into XPUCreateWidgets is used.
    inCount: Ignored, left for backward compatibility (integer)
    inParamParent: ID of the parent
    ioWidgets: list, will contain IDs of the newly created widgets
